# Azure Machine Learning Services and Azure Databricks

Working as a consultant in the Microsoft Azure Cloud I am continuously implementing artificial intelligent (machine learning and deep learning) solutions in a variety of different ways to suit the client's needs. With this experience I have grown to really love implementing solutions using both the Azure Machine Learning Service (AML Service) and Azure Databricks. 

Azure Machine Learning Service is a platform that allows data scientists and data engineers to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models at scale and in the cloud. Developers can build intelligent algorithms into applications and worflows using popular Python-based libraries like TensorFlow, Pytorch, and Scikit-learn. The AML Service is a framework that allows developers to train where ever they choose, then wrap their model in a docker container and deploy to any container orchestrator they wish!
