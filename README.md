# Azure Machine Learning With Azure Databricks
This repository highlights the workflow and ease of use of training machine learning or deep learning models using Azure Databricks. Then deploying those models on both the AML Service and Azure Databricks. There are many demos and documentation of this workflow available by Microsoft, however, I hope to provide and end to end walkthrough in a single location.   

We will be using the popular MNIST example, and will be following closerly with this Azure Machine Learning Service example [here](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/tutorials/img-classification-part1-training.ipynb).  


## Blog
This type of model training and deployment is common with clients I work with. Therefore, I wrote a [blog](./blog/AMLWithDatabricks.md) describing tips and why a developer would choose to deploy using AML Service and Databricks.  

## Walkthrough
Please complete the following in order for an end to end implementation:
